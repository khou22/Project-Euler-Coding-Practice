# Project-Euler-Coding-Practice
This is where I will upload my solutions to <a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> problems. This site is designed to present brain teasers that must be solved using a combination of math and programming. This is a good way for me to not only practice new languages, but also a way for me to excercise the coding-sector of my brain. I will not save all the solutions (I plan on overwriting them), but they will be stored in version history.

I am writing primarily in Swift right now because that is the language I am trying to improve in. I know it isn't typically intended to solve these types of problems, but it works all the same.
